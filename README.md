# Boost Training Systems
This project is an online business page for James Kraus's coaching business.

This page meets the following requirements: CSS animation, responsive navigation menu, media queries for small and large screens,
and a pop-up window that stores name, email, and biography info from prospective customers wanting to schedule a consultation. The CSS
animation is a change in the hamburger menu from parallel lines to a cross shape when clicked. The responsive navigation menu is a column-
oriented menu bar located off screen on devices smaller than 800px wide, which slides on and off screen when the menu button is clicked.
The menu relocates and reorients to a row of items in the banner on devices larger than 800px wide. Other media queries involve reoriganizing
content from column to row and increasing font-sizes to make the page more readable on larger screens. Finally, the "schedule a consultation"
button click triggers a javascript form to open. The form stores name, email, and biography information, returns error messages if the
content filled in does not meet character or syntax requirements, and returns a confirmation message upon submission of correct information.
