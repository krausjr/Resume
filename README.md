# Boost Training Systems
This project is an online business page for James Kraus's coaching business.

This page meets the following requirements: CSS animation, responsive navigation menu, media queries for medium and large screens,
and a modal form that validates inputs for name, email, and biography info from prospective customers wanting to schedule a consultation. The CSS
animation is a change in the hamburger menu from parallel lines to a cross shape when clicked. The responsive navigation menu is a column-
oriented menu bar located off screen on devices smaller than 786px wide, which slides on and off screen when the menu button is clicked.
The menu relocates and reorients to a row of items in the banner on devices 786px wide or larger. Other media queries involve reoriganizing content in
css grid and increasing font-sizes to make the page more readable on larger screens. Finally, the "schedule a consultation"
button click triggers a modal form to open. The form takes user input in the form of name, email, and biography information, returns error messages if the user submits a blank or incomplete form, and returns a confirmation message with the user's name upon submission of three valid fields.
